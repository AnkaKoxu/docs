From now on you can add so-called chests to the server shop, which are able to randomly give players money, roles or other items.

## Stockmarket

We added a new command **/stockmarket**, which allows you to virtually buy stocks of known companies.

To start using this feature on your server, go to the command configuration in the Economy plugin and set the dollar converter to your server currency.

Users will be able to buy stocks using the command **/stockmarket buy \[amount] \[name]**.
Bought stocks can be viewed using the command **/stockmarket backpack**, and then sold for a profit using **/stockmarket sell**.

The list of all available stocks is listed on the page: [https://startit.bot/stocks](https://startit.bot/stocks)

Happy trading, future investors!

## Divided plugins into few categories

We split plugins into categories to make them easier to find:
 - **Server management** (Embeds, Welcomes, Auto roles, Selfroles, Stats, Social notifications)
 - **Engagement and fun** (Economy, Levels, Giveaways, Auto channels, Images, Tools)
 - **Server moderation** (Moderation, Auto mod, Logs, Auto responder, Moderated channels, Tickets)
